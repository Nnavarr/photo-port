### Description 
The following web page was created using React; a JavaScript library developed by Facebook that uses a virtual DOM to create fluid Single Page Applications. 

For this mock site, we created a website for a photographer. The site features various photo galleries that are conditionally rendered based on the category selected on the navigation bar. Additionally, the "Contact" section features a form that is rendered within the same page which also includes email validation through React's controlled component feature; data can be validated or manipulated using JavaScript using the components state.

Happy browsing!
